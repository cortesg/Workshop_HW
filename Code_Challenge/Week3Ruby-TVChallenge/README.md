# TVChallenge

Note: The first 2 commits were work done under an hour.

Goal:

To gauge your your understanding of Ruby object oriented programming.

Mission:

Create an object that represents a television. Take a moment to think of the behavior of a television set as well as the properties that it possesses. Take into account how you expect a television to operate. The following are a list of the minimum requirements that are necessary for this assessment.

Basic Requirements:

TV must be class and consequently you must create an instance of that class (object)
Must be able to turn TV on and off
Must be able to turn the volume up or volume down
Must be able to mute and unmute volume (similar to TV on/off)
Must be able to switch channels by going up in number or down (similar to volume)
Additional: (Must include AT LEAST 2 from the list below)

Change a channel by passing in the channel number
Display the current channel number
The channel cannot be greater than 100 or less than 1
The volume cannot be greater than 32 or less than 1
Display the current volume
Extra (if you want to be fancy):

When you mute and unmute make sure the TV restores the pre muted volume
When doing a volume up or down and the TV is currently muted then unmute it, restore the pre muted volume and then make sure to change the volume to the appropriate level
Add any other extra features that you feel may be nice to have
 

Grading criteria:

Incomplete - Attempted all the basics plus 2 additions but it does not work and/or did not attempt.

Complete - All basic requirements plus 2 additions are working.

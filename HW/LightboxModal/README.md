# Lightbox

Let's build a JavaScript lightbox together! A lightbox is an easy way to display a photo above other content on the page. It should have the following features:

A snippet like this should be all you need on the .html side:

html <a href="#" data-img="whale.jpg" class="lightbox-link">Click here to view a photo that's a whale of a tale</a>

The snippet includes the image to open inside the tag.

When clicked, the image should open with an opaque background so the user can see it large on top of all existing content. It should also be centered vertically and horizontally.

When the user clicks on the image or its border, the lightbox should close.

MODALS:

A modal is similar to a lightbox in that it obscures existing content on the page to alert the user to an important fact or bit of text.

Create a modal that opens when a user clicks on a link or button on the page. The modal should be centered vertically and horizontally and show text that the user didn't previously see on the page. When the user clicks on the modal or around it, it should disappear.

Grading Criteria
The modal can be created in JavaScript or jQuery.

The syntax is correct and the code is indented properly.

The modal should:

Be centered vertically and horizontally on the page
Show text that does not already appear on the page
Disappear when the user clicks on the modal or around it

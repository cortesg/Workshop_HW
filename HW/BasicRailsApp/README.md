# BasicRails

Rails: Create a new Rails application from scratch with one controller that has at least three views. Try hard to not look at your class work, but feel free to consult Google and the Rails documentation.

Ruby: Create an object to model something in the real world. Then, extend the object with another object that is more specific. For example, create an Animal object with attributes that all animals have and then a Bird object that extends animal and has traits specific to birds. Give examples of using each object after they have been declared including assigning attributes and using instance methods.

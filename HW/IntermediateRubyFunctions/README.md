# IntermediateRubyFunctions

Create a function that rotates the items in an array by n steps and returns the rotated array. The function should take in an array, and how many spaces it should rotate (n).

Do not use Ruby's built-in Array.rotate function.

Example: If your input is: ["cat", "dog", "mouse", "shoe"], 2 Your output should be: ["mouse", "shoe", "cat", "dog"]

If your input is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1 Your output should be: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Extra Credit:
Be able to accept negative n values and rotate your array backwards. Example: If your input is: ["cat", "dog", "mouse", "shoe"], -1 Your output should be: ["dog", "mouse", "shoe", "cat"]

Design your function to rotate the array 'in place', meaning it will perform the operation without creating additional arrays.






Create an n factorial function. A factorial is the evaluation of n! - This number is calculated by multiplying every number from 1 to and including n.

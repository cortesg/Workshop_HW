# Rails Secure Auth Model from Scratch

Being able to log users into your app securely is an incredibly important part of constructing a web application. We'll be relying on this blog post:

http://nycda.com/blog/basic-user-authentication-model-in-rails-4 (Links to an external site.)
http://nycdaglobal.wpengine.com/blog/basic-user-authentication-model-in-rails-4/

to learn how to create our own today.

First, the instructor will guide you through the post so you understand the basics. Then, you'll try rolling your own user authentication with the help of your instructor and the blog post.

When all is said and done, you should be able to create a Rails app that allows users to sign up and sign in securely.
